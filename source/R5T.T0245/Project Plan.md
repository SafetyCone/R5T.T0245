Types library for leaf strong-types. (catch-all for all- or undetermined-opinon leaf strong types)
[Public, Corporate, all- or undetermined-opinion, all-domain, catch-all for leaf strong types]

Contains *only* leaf strong-types (those strong types with no inheritance relationship with any other strong type).
Additionally, this library contains *all* leaf strong-types.

To create a curated collection library of specific leaf strong-types, duplicate the type from this library *but retain the type in this library*!
(Add a note the for the type name of the curatated collection library in the remaining type.)
It is not possible to have multiple implementation types for the same conceptual type since it is possible to note the *official* selction for the conceptual type in an official selections library.
